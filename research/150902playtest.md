Christina
* conservative and rational tack: most likely
* singularity is fucking stupid
* playing to win

Chris
* activist investor: mix of where the world would go and what was likely
* emotionally pressure people to make deals they didn't want to make
* maximized number of cards
* favorite trade: give up longevity (everyone wanted) to capture DRUG, HSTY, UNIC (good to mediocre)
* looking for volume
* hedging
* HFT: real limit was the amount of time
* quickly valued pile, then could run around and trade the rest
* get a broad game experience
* the more you trade the more you can learn how to strategize
* AI politician: wasn't emotional, but should have been (AI is emotional)

Alex
* no time to read or understand
* held on to what people asked her for
* Machiavelian: Dismantling the Internet (gives you the most power)
* quantity and panic: didn't understand the game, surely must be losing

Daniel
* broker bot: traded away good stuff at the end out of panic
* body: preservation of human life
* pure capitalism: disappearing resources
* I was investing for myself trying to win the game for humanity
* if you don't invest in sustainable energy there's no point in preserving your body

Rob
* binary sort: believe::don't believe
* diverse portfolio
* top 5 as most valuable... 2for1 was possible
* would do research that I believe in
* futures future: cheap energy (endlessly delayed, but a good future)
* prenatal: children are a futures future
* hedges: 10HR is a dog, but people want more stable income (UNIC)
* self-driving cars are the future, can't have with human drivers
* people will die for their rights: if you can go to war you can make it happen
* some are purchasable, networked future:
* history: is law adverse, it always is there
* NOIP: would never pass
* portfolio balancing: metric with personal/emotion on top of it
* facebook is voting: see this as political instead of economics–invest in demographics to
* labour in the system is to increase the amount of information: starting point is important: users enhance, rather than we make it perfect: zero-state is important

Chelsea

* relating game to reality/money

Parisi
* good vs. bad for humanity
* bet against humanity
* long term thinking
* history: good for humanity
* AI Politician: would be dystopian: people might get behind but it would suck

* pick the most desirable from each category
* important to have each of them
* tech: has news all the time
* social stuff is hard to grasp: eg. family diversity

Joe
* guess most likely: continuing existing trends
* 2nd round: driven by payoff function ($1)–no prize for second place, so build correlation-driven portfolio: entirely tech, multiple shares of few things: home run hitter



Best futures
* Cab: LONG
* Christina: EXCZ (never thought about, but seemed likely)
* Chris: Health sector seemed relevant
* Alex: Prenatal immunization (motto was really strong)
* Dan: Energy (self-interest but not the best written)
* Rob: EXCZ (trend line is strong)
* Chelsea: SING (future beyond human comprehnsion: interesting)
* Parisi: AI Politician (intriguing concept), right discrepency between we need but it will never happen, you can imagine it, it could be good or bad
* Dorothy: UNIC (topic is good, bad copy)
* Joe: human driver ban (take to the next level: definitive... ENGY is not definitive, it's too qualitiative)

Worst futures
* Cab: PRENATAL (bad string of words)
* Cab: HISTORICAL (clumsy title, good copy)
* Chistina/Alex: AI politician (unlikely)
* Chris: political/policy
* Chris: sex it up to sell
* Dan: Drone not written well (there is something there, but not the right arg/angle)
* Rob: SINGULARITY (too far away, I believe in people); AI POL (bad); 10HR (didn't care)
* Chelsea: Drone ban (too present, it's happening)
* Chelsea: couldn't scan for the information (need a universal format), some start with the problem we have now (ENGY: good because like science fiction: what we have now and how it is different)
* Parisi: Drone too simple
* History: good topic, more populist
* Dorothy: Drone and Self-driving car is too close
* Joe: AI politician (but likes that there there something that people don't like)

* take it outside of the walls of the exhibition: monetization strategy



Feature Requests

* broker bot/insider trading
* balancing function on portfolio: for oracularity/prescience (executive wikipedia editors who can ajudicate the market)
* penalize static portfolios and for raiding a company

* Bitcoin: compelling because can transact with the real world: effect the programming–inherently non-symbolic
* quarterly returns: the pulse of the market: needs synchrounus events and a source of truth: timed events and unmovable truths... game that ends and begins again: more like sporting: the meaningful turn
