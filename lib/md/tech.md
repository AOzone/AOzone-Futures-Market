* C2Sense
uses carbon nanotubes to tell you when your food has gone bad. This new cost-effective sensing system will help address the problem of waste by allowing growers, shippers, distributors, retailers and consumers to make dynamic decisions to reduce waste at every stage. (can reduce the 1.3 billion tons per year of food wastage)
“Our mission is to bring a sense of smell to the digital world. With our technology, that package of steaks in your refrigerator will tell you when it’s about to go bad, recommend some recipe options and help build out your shopping list,” said Jan Schnorr, Chief Technology Officer of C2Sense.

## Transporation
* self-driving cars
* Car to Car communication
http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/534981/car-to-car-communication/

## GEO
* Ultra accurate weather forecasts -- this is good for cheap energy too
http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/526541/smart-wind-and-solar-power/
* Reverse osmosis desalination - removing salt from water on a megascale
http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/534996/megascale-desalination/
* Atmospheric Water Harvesting
solve drought problem, collecting water and moisture from the atmosphere using micro netting. These micro nets collect water that drains down into a collection chamber. This fresh water can then be stored or channelled into homes and farms as needed. http://www.seriouswonder.com/atmospheric-water-harvesting-could-solve-california-drought/
