As new technologies, particularly digital, continue to subsume every aspect of our transactions, working life, and value systems, a new form of political economy is emerging that has the similar exploitative effects of capitalism, but is something altogether different.

Media technology not only extend the capacity of the human body and mind, they also transform it. The current acceleration of these technologies are pushing us beyond our historical limits at an unseen rate, mutating our very being beyond what might be considered _human_.

Centralized institutions like cities, universities, banks and states have provided the scaffolding for modern life. As the Internet comes to fully mediate social life, education, finance and citizenship, it will bring its decentralizing force to every aspect of our lives, replacing the institutional apparatus with a new distributed order.


### PAST–Pastoralist

Our Silicon Valley-fueled techno-infused obsessions have gone too far. Airbnb destablizes homeownership as Uber strips employees of the hard-won rights of industrial labour. Life used to be good, why did we decide to ruin it? The breaking point is coming soon when humans will choose humanity over abstraction.


### CMON–Communal

Communism failed in large part due to a lack of suitable technology. When artificially intelligent robots finally liberate humans from toiling away as laborers, they will produce a large enough surplus that we can all live luxurious lives without our current inequality of super rich and dirt poor.


### AARC–Anarchist

Politics is old technology. Digital protocols and networks, like those of open source collaboration and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, have proven to be much more effective in organizing productive collective life that our broken political order. The latter will break down while this new order will continue to ascend, bringing us finally into a stable anarchy.


### PODM–Post-Democratic

If the multi-millenia experiment with democracy has taught us anything, it's that it is a system prone to exploitation. The influence of wealth in the US and xenophobia in Europe, for example, have become so explicit that democracy is no longer a viable cover for the forms of power that work below it. Having lost its virtue, democracy will topple into a new form of enlightened governance.


### CALI–Californian

In California, for-profit and for-good are not at odds. Rather, they will come together in a cocktail of innovation that will push the world into an apolitical paradise where meritocracy reigns and the many of technological prowess have power over the few of neo-aristocratic birthright.


### PUNK–Cyberpunk

The real world has become less real than the digital world. Cyberspace is now home, all the rest is just a waiting room. With advancements in cheap networked virtual reality and nootropics, our bodies will become mere conduits to completely new experiences offered by ever more powerful digital-chemical cocktails.


### PLTY–Plentiful

Climate change is just a wake up call, a catalyst to finally achieve the hard problems of engineering. Thermonuclear energy will dismantle the petrochemical world order, and geoengineering and asteroid mining will shut the door on scarcity thinking forever. A world of abundance will ensue, a paradise on earth free of resource anxiety and other triggers of war.


### SMRT–Smart

Humans used to have a monopoly on intelligence. As more and more objects are embedded with computation and networked together, we will have finally played God, breathing life into the dead world around us. This newly smart environment of buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure will converse, transact and strategize with not only us, but also a sea of objects on and around us.
