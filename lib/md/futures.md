### Superlongevity
Engineering the body to survive for hundreds of years radically alters social orders tethered to life cycles, from education and retirement to family size and wealth accumulation.

### Basic Universal Income
A more even distribution of the resources of the world creates a society of equality in which everyone can contribute without anxiety over the bare essentials.

### Drug Decriminalization
Augmenting human performance with narcotics is a necessary strategy to compete in a global world of machines.

### Voluntary Employment
Offloading labour to robots allows humanity to evolve to a post-scarcity state where everyone can choose how they want to spend their time.

### Cheap Energy -- Infinite Energy? Boundless Energy?
Cheap in cost and externalities like pollution, energy sources like thermonuclear or solar will save us from climate change and the oppression of petro-regimes.

### Designer Evolution
Manipulating our genetic inheritance allows us to finally take control of the trajectory of our species.

### Universal Chronicle
A common, unimpeachable, searchable and verifiable register of historical facts takes history out of the sole hands of its winners.

### Algorithmic Governance
Inert or artificially intelligent political machines remove the bias from governance in favor of equity and sustainable resource management.

### Contractual Families
In an increasingly globally dispersed world, updating the family unit to be post-bloodlines creates a new stability mechanism for the nomadic.

### Memory Manipulation
Increased understanding of the brain and long-term immersion in virtual reality allows for the manipulation of our minds in ways that redefine what it means to be human.

### Extrastate Citizenship
Belonging to advocacy communities that are not tethered to physical territories increases mobility and stability in an increasingly unstable world.

## Promiscuous Citizenship

### Robotic Medicine
Nano-technology and the 3D printing of organic tissue offers a new class of biological machines that engineer our health from within our bodies.

### Privatized Identity
In an era of gene sequencing and manipulation, selling your genetic code allows you to profit from your best assets.

### Identity Cloaking
Anonymity in our state of ubiquitous surveillance and drone warfare preserves the modern ideals of critical knowledge production and juridical due diligence.

### Post-Human Driving
Banning the human operation of all vehicles on land, sea and air optimizes transport for speed, energy use and safety.

### Global Net Neutrality
Connecting the entire world to the Internet and keeping it open and free accelerates human evolution.

### Common Intellectual Property
Open sourcing the collective intelligence of human knowledge benefits the many rather than enriching the few.

### Disembodied Cognition
Turning our brains into a global super computer will bring civilization to a new order of understanding, productivity and enrichment.

### Extraterrestrial Living
Our condition of increasing resource scarcity is eradicated by the colonization of other planets and mineral rich asteroids.

### Deathless Combat
Wars fought by robotic proxy keeps the human tradition of conflict in play while removing human life from the equation.

### Asteroid Shield
Protecting the Earth from rare but catastrophic cosmic collisions is a form of insurance that lets us focus our productive attention on the foreseeable future.

### Enforced Primitivism
Putting a lid on a techno-progress run amok lets us return to a prelapsarian pastoral bliss.

### Sexbots
Sexually skilled robots that never say no. Combined with hyperreal virtual reality and bio-synthetic material, sex is decoupled from coupling and has finally arrived at the selfishness for which our bodies were designed.

### Non-Biological Thinking
Augment your intelligence by outsourcing some of your thinking to machines. Brain-control allows direct interfacing between your mind and lightning quick processors and fail-safe memory in wearables and in the cloud. Scale your knowledge and creativity throughout the day.

### Disembodied Cognition
Humans no longer have a monopoly on understanding. Artificial intelligence has become self-aware. It's no longer just about solving math problems or searching the Internet. Human being is now just one among many forms of being.
