Hard resources are scarce, but information is abundant.


Need to take over the awards page and give specific examples of what we want people to do and how they will be rewarded:
* be pulled into a Slack channel with Gugg curators
* invited to Google hangout with curators
* invited to the museum for a private tour and meeting
* profiled on the blog
* guest post on the blog
* easter eggs: artists have left them throughout the site


* Leaderboard
* other analytics?
