As more and more historical registers become digital, the ability to both rewrite and erase history has become increasingly easy. The power that was once limited to scholars and leaders is now in the hands of everyday hackers. A Global Crypto-Register would securely hold records (from land registries and birth records to scorekeeping and news articles), ensuring the first truly comprehensive representation of the past. Entries into the register would still be recorded with bias, but no one will have the power to erase any records. History doesn’t have to be written by winners any more."

Rather than running on fallible, emotionally unstable, unpredictable human will, a governance system fueled by artificial intelligence would not bear grudges, owe favors or suffer moods. Designating artificial intelligence legislators is not giving control to machines. An AI Governance System would be programmed to represent universally favorable values, providing truly representative governance. The problem with politics is politicians."

If new families are already being created outside of the traditions of blood lines and surnames, the next logical step is to allow individuals to form families at will and design the relationships between members while retaining the rights afforded a family. A Contractual Family would be legally binding for a specific period of time, allowing individuals to create temporary dependent relationships. The notion of committing to anything for a lifetime no longer makes sense. Choose to file taxes jointly and share federal issued benefits with the logical choice for now."

Increasingly indistinguishable from reality, VR is primarily used in the entertainment industry as a tool to transport you to another world. Why not utilize the technology as an immersive time capsule? If your entire life was recorded, you could travel back in time with VR Memory Playback and re-live your memories. Potential applications range from daily recollection to literally walking in someone else’s shoes. In an increasingly oversaturated world, VR Memory Playback would take on the burden of memory allowing people to focus on the present."

With an increase in our lives being lived online, from work to socializing, we are not as tethered to physical space as we once were. Why, then, is citizenship our principal form of identification? Extrastate citizenship offers the protection of a country without the limitations of being saddled with resources to protect and wars to wage.

Today, doppelgangers are constructed with plastic surgery, but in the future one could design their baby to take on the visage, personality or talent of their favorite pop or sports star.

They will increase mobility for those who can’t drive themselves and have the potential to revolutionize infrastructure, regional travel, and vehicular accident rates.

Regulation has rendered the internet unrecognizable; opaque policies benefit the minority, and push criminal activity deeper underground. The internet as a democratic space for open communication is a distant memory.

More than just enabling and protecting free speech, an open internet ensures universal access to knowledge. Global Net Neutrality would prevent individual countries from regulating the internet, ensuring international open communication.

This kind of system not only ensures a basic standard of living, it supports a flexible, freelance lifestyle.

Prohibition is a financial and social burden that has not diminished drug use or abuse. In fact, the disproportionate value placed upon illegal substances has given criminals the upper hand. Drug decriminalization would allow qualified physicians to monitor and regulate dosages of even the most potent drugs. Let science shape policy, and take the authority away from criminals."

Labor will be increasingly augmented by machines, but also autonomous machines will have the potential to construct everything from small scale devices to large-scale infrastructure without human supervision.

Bureaucratic barriers have hindered the push towards renewable and sustainable energy.  Energy Democratization would both ensure the development of affordable energy and mandate the even distribution of energy globally, producing more than enough energy to sustain a high standard of living for every person on the planet.
