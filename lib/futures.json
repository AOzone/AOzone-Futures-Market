As more and more historical registers become digital, the ability to both rewrite and erase history has become increasingly easy. The power that was once limited to scholars and leaders is now in the hands of everyday hackers. A Universal Impregnable Historical Register would securely hold records (from land registries and birth records to scorekeeping and news articles), ensuring the first truly comprehensive representation of the past. Entries into the register could still be recorded with bias, but no one will have the power to edit data after the fact."

If your entire life was recorded, you could travel back in time with VR and re-live your memories. Potential applications range from daily recollection to literally walking in someone else’s shoes. In an increasingly oversaturated world, VR Memory Playback would take the burden of memory allowing people to focus on the present."

Every self-driving car accident to date has been caused by human error, either in an adjacent car or through manual override. Banning human drivers entirely would ensure that self-driving cars could operate safely and efficiently. "
