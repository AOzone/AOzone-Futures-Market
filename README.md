# Åzone Futures Market

## What?
The Åzone Futures Market is a didactic machine for structuring a general public discourse on the effects of new technologies through a simulated futures investment market.

## Why?
Digital technologies introduce a new logic from those we are accustomed to in the physical world. They are not only historically new and different, they operate according to a different dynamics: their rules emerge over time, rather than pre-exist awaiting discovery. As these technologies seep from the confines of digital environments into our physical world, they bring this new dynamic with them, as well as its emergent uncertainty. This collision is already having fundamental effects on contemporary life at all levels, social and psychic, political and cultural.

The Åzone Project is an attempt to design and build infrastructure for making sense of these effects as they emerge. Which ones do we collectively wish to embrace? Which do we fear? What are the value systems and beliefs that inform these decisions? What are the predictions that inform these ideologies? And what are the appropriate venues, formats and protocols for this discussion to take place on a planetary scale?

## How?
Unlike direct discursive forms, such as writing, the market format allows for a mix of direct and emergent behavior. While all participants take the form of investor, their moves will be partly driven by authentic desires and partly by responding to internal market dynamics. While some purchases will reflect futures that the investor is genuinely interested in materializing, others may be a result of pure market speculation. As such, this discursive form simulates the dynamics it is designed to investigate.

In order to connect this market simulation to the real world, investors will be incentivized to reveal the impetus of their actions. By connecting information in the form of text, links, images, audio and video to their trades, they will produce a unique discourse graph of events and statements that are driving their investment strategies.

Understanding this complex will require a new form of discourse analysis. Working with architects, artists, technologists, theorists and others, we will develop a series of `indices` that will track different aspects of the market according to specific ideological world views. By opening an API to market data, we will allow others to create visualizations and other ciphers to read the market.

## When and Where?
The Åzone Futures Market will launch online in the fall of 2015. The online market can be found at [url coming soon](http://).

Physical installations of the _Åzone Terminal_, a multi-screen interactive environment that gives a real-time image of different aspects of the market, will be on view in New York and Shenzhen in fall/winter 2015-2016. Future installations may also occur.

## Who?
### Investors
Signing up for the market is free and open to the public. A finite amount of the internal currency, `cåin`, will be distributed to begin investing. Playing the market will allow investors to increase their portfolio over time.

### Advisers
A group of advisers will create the contracts, feed the information stream, and design the indices. Investors can advance to this level by displaying acumen in the market. Advisers are listed in the [contributors.json](/contributors.json) file.

### Market Engine
@dochugo is building the market engine that will create the market pricing algorithm.

### Design
Marco Ferrari of [Folder Studio](studiofolder.it) is leading the design.

### Platform
@broskoski, co-founder of [Are.na](https://www.are.na), is developing the backend on top of the Are.na API to integrate with the existing community and content structure.

### Initiator
The Åzone project is driven by Architecture and Digital Initiatives at the [Guggenheim](http://www.guggenheim.org), led by @troyth with @admendelsohn.
