### Abstract
New technologies that challenge our social foundations are entering our lives at an increasing rate, destabilizing the worldviews, institutions, ethics and practices that have structured our collective experience for centuries. The accelerating rate of this flood exceeds the limits of our capacity to understand its consequences and thereby to steward the lives we want to live. The Ã…zone Futures Market provides a public testing ground to learn about and experiment with the potential effects of some of the most transformative of these technologies in a simulated stock market. Including dynamic pricing, indices and funds, crowd-sourced news feeds, market commentary and centralized manipulation, it will provide investors with the apparatus to take a position on the future they wish to live and to track its emergence. Writers and theorists will contribute market analyses and investment strategies to articulate the consequences of certain positions, and artists, architects, designers and technologists will design awards to incentivize behavior beyond pure market speculation. Guggenheim curators will profile investors who display different forms of strategic intelligence, asking them to share their insights and to advise on upcoming programming.
