### Abstract
New technologies that challenge our social foundations are entering our lives at an increasing rate, destabilizing the worldviews, institutions, ethics and practices that have structured our collective experience for centuries. The accelerating rate of this flood exceeds the limits of our capacity to understand its consequences and thereby to steward the lives we want to live. The Åzone Futures Market provides a public testing ground to learn about and experiment with the potential effects of some of the most transformative of these technologies in a simulated stock market. Including dynamic pricing, indices and funds, crowd-sourced news feeds, and market commentary and centralized manipulation, it will provide investors with the apparatus to take a position on the future they wish to live and to track its emergence. Artists, architects, designers, technologists and writers will contribute trend analyses and investment strategies to articulate the consequences of certain positions, and work with Guggenheim curators to determine a reward system to incentivize behavior. Awarded investors will be profiled on the site in order to share their strategy and insight, and will be invited to advise on upcoming Guggenheim cultural programming.
